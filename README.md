# Classify-Abundant-Perfect-Deficient by Gabriel Perez
This program classifies an integer as deficient, perfect, or abundant as well as prime or composite.
Integer must be a whole postive number. If you enter a negative number, a negative number with a decimal, or
a positive number with a decimal, you will get an error and the program will prompt you to try again with positive
whole integer.

Once you input a positive whole number, a function will classify that number as abundant, deficient, or perfect.

An abundant number is a number whose factors besides the number itself add up to more than the number inputted. For example,
12 is an abundant number. The factors of 12 include 1,2,3,4, and 6 which adds up to 16 which is greater than 12.

A perfect number is a number whose factors besides the number itself equals the number inputted. For example, 6 is a perfect number.
The factors of 6 are 1,2, and 3 which adds up to 6 as well.

A deficient number is a number whose factors besides the number itself adds up to less than the number inputted. For example, 8 is a
deficient number. The factors of 8 include 1,2, and 4 which adds up to 7. 7 is less than 8.

Once classifed as abundant, deficient, or perfect, the program will also classify the number inputted as prime or composite.

A prime number is a number which only has two factors, 1 and the number itself. For example, 7 is a prime number. The only two factors
for 7 is 1 and 7.

A composite number is a number which has more than two factors. For example, 10 is a composite number. The factors of 10 include 1,2,
5, and 10.
